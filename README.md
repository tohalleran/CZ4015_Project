# CZ4015_Project
I took this course at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) for Spring 2018.
The project description can be found in the repo. Had to implement a simulator and write a report of my results.
Contains all the java code used in completing the course project. However, I did not commit any R code used in this project.
I completed the project using Java, Apache POI to read data from the excel file, and R for data analytics.
